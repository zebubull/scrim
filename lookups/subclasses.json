Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility has long been valued during times of war and peace.\n\n",
      "description": "Tool Proficiency\n\nWhen you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.\n\nAlchemist Spells\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don\u2019t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.\n\nAlchemist Spells\n  -- 3rd:  Healing Word, Ray of Sickness \n  -- 5th:  Flaming Sphere, Melf's Acid Arrow \n  -- 9th:  Gaseous Form, Mass Healing Word \n  -- 13th:  Blight, Death Ward \n  -- 17th:  Cloudkill, Raise Dead \n\nExperimental Elixir\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.\n\nYou can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.\n\nCreating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.\n\nWhen you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.\n\nExperimental Elixir\n  -- 1:  Healing. The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence Modifier \n  -- 2:  Swiftness. The drinker's walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour. \n  -- 3:  Resilience. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes. \n  -- 4:  Boldness. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute. \n  -- 5:  Flight. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes. \n  -- 6:  Transformation. The drinker's body is transformed as if by the Alter Self spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes. \n\nAlchemical Savant\n\nAt 5th level, you've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nRestorative Reagents\n\nStarting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:\n\n  -- Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).\n\n  -- You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nChemical Mastery\n\nBy 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:\n\n  -- You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.\n\n  -- You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist\u2019s supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n"

      "name": "Artificer: Armorer",
      "description_short": "Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything\n\nAn artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.\n\n",
      "description": "Tools of the Trade\n\nWhen you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.\n\nArmorer Spells\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.\n\nArmorer Spells\n  -- 3rd:  Magic Missile, Thunderwave \n  -- 5th:  Mirror Image, Shatter \n  -- 9th:  Hypnotic Pattern, Lightning Bolt \n  -- 13th:  Fire Shield, Greater Invisibility \n  -- 17th:  Passwall, Wall of Force \n\nArcane Armor\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.\n\nYou gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:\n\n  -- If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.\n\n  -- You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.\n\n  -- The armor attaches to you and can\u2019t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.\n\n  -- You can doff or don the armor as an action.\n\nThe armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.\n\nArmor Model\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.\n\nEach model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.\n\nYou can change the armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.\n\nGuardian. You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:\n\n  -- Thunder Gauntlets. Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.\n\n  -- Defensive Field. As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nInfiltrator. You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:\n\n  -- Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.\n\n  -- Powered Steps. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.\n\n  -- Dampening Field. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.\n\nExtra Attack\n\nStarting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n\nArmor Modifications\n\nAt 9th level, you learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.\n\nPerfected Armor\n\nAt 15th level, your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.\n\nGuardian. When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.\n\nYou can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\n\nInfiltrator. Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.\n\n"

    "artificer: artillerist": {
      "name": "Artificer: Artillerist",
      "description_short": "Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything/Eberron: Rising from the Last War\n\nAn Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds. And when war passes, some members of this specialization seek to build a more peaceful world by using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping gnome artificer Vi has been especially vocal about making things right: \"It's about time we fixed things instead of blowing them all to hell.\"\n\n",
      "description": "Tool Proficiency\n\nWhen you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.\n\nArtillerist Spells\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don\u2019t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.\n\nArtillerist Spells\n  -- 3rd:  Shield, Thunderwave \n  -- 5th:  Scorching Ray, Shatter \n  -- 9th:  Fireball, Wind Wall \n  -- 13th:  Ice Storm, Wall of Fire \n  -- 17th:  Cone of Cold, Wall of Force \n\nEldritch Cannon\n\nAlso at 3rd level, you've learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.\n\nThe cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.\n\nWhen you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.\n\nEldritch Cannon\n  -- Flamethrower:  The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. \n  -- Force Ballista:  Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon. \n  -- Protector:  The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). \n\nArcane Firearm\n\nAt 5th level, You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.\n\nYou can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.\n\nExplosive Cannon\n\nStarting at 9th level, every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive:\n\n  -- The cannon's damage rolls all increase by 1d8.\n\n  -- As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nFortified Position\n\nBy 15th level, you\u2019re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannon:\n\n  -- You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.\n\n  -- You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.\n\n"

It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.\n\nIn combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n\nIf the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.\n\nAt the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have smith's tools with you.

Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.\n\nYou can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn.

When you make a successful ranged attack with a thrown weapon using Strength, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the attack\u2019s damage roll.\n\n  -- Giant Stature. Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn\u2019t enough room for you to increase your size, your size doesn\u2019t change.\n\nElemental Cleaver\n\n6th-Level Path of the Giant Feature\n\nYour bond with the elemental might of giants grows, and you learn to infuse weapons with primordial energy.\n\nWhen you enter your rage, you can choose one weapon that you are holding and infuse it with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, thunder, or lightning. While you wield the infused weapon during your rage, the weapon\u2019s damage type changes to the chosen type, it deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type when it hits, and it gains the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you throw the weapon, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target. The infused weapon\u2019s benefits are suppressed while a creature other than you wields it.\n\nWhile raging and holding the infused weapon, you can use a bonus action to change the infused weapon\u2019s current damage type to another one from the damage type options above.\n\nMighty Impel\n\n10th-Level Path of the Giant Feature\n\nYour connection to giant strength allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. As a bonus action while raging, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.\n\nIf, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn\u2019t on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing prone.\n\nDemiurgic Colossus\n\n14th-Level Path of the Giant Feature\n\nThe primordial power of your rage intensifies. When you rage, your reach increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Large or Huge (your choice), and you can use your Mighty Impel to move creatures that are Large or smaller.\n\nIn addition, the extra damage dealt by your Elemental Cleaver feature increases to 2d6.\n\n"

      "description_short": "Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything\n\nTypical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.\n\n",

The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.\n\nYour aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.\n\nIf your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.\n\nDesert. When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.\n\nSea. When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.\n\nTundra. When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.\n\nStorm Soul\n\nAt 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.\n\nDesert. You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don\u2019t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.\n\nSea. You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\nTundra. You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don\u2019t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.\n\nShielding Storm\n\nAt 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.\n\nRaging Storm\n\nAt 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.\n\nDesert. Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your Barbarian level.\n\nSea. When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.\n\nTundra. Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.\n\n"

At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.\n\nYour totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.\n\nBear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\n\nElk. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.\n\nTiger. You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.\n\nWolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.\n\nSpirit Walker\n\nAt 10th level, you can cast the Commune with Nature spell, but only as a ritual.

You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.\n\nBear. While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.\n\nEagle. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.\n\nElk. While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.\n\nTiger. While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.\n\nWolf.

The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature\u2019s choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can\u2019t receive it again until after a long rest.\n\nYou can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nUnstable Backlash\n\nAt 10th level, when you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out; immediately after you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use your reaction to roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.\n\nControlled Surge\n\nAt 14th level, whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash.

Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.\n\n",
      "description": "Guiding Whispers\n\nAt 3rd level, you can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn\u2019t count against the number of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.\n\nSpiritual Focus\n\nAt 3rd level, you employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.\n\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.\n\nTales from Beyond\n\nAt 3rd level, you reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale\u2019s effect or you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale\u2019s effect. Once you do so, you can\u2019t bestow the tale\u2019s effect again until you roll it again.\n\nYou can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.\n\nIf the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.\n\nSpirit Tales\n  -- 1:  Tale of the Clever Animal. For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma check, the target can roll an extra die immediately after rolling the d20 and add the extra die's number to the check. The extra die is the same type as your Bardic Inspiration die. \n  -- 2:  Tale of the Renowned Duelist. You make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. \n  -- 3:  Tale of the Beloved Friends. The target and another creature of its choice it can see within 5 feet of it gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier \n  -- 4:  Tale of the Runaway. The target can immediately use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the target teleports, it can choose a number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) to immediately use the same reaction. \n  -- 5:  Tale of the Avenger. For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes force damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die. \n  -- 6:  Tale of the Traveler. The target gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your bard level. While it has these temporary hit points, the target\u2019s walking speed increases by 10 feet and it gains a +1 bonus to its AC. \n  -- 7:  Tale of the Beguiler. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die, and the target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. \n  -- 8:  Tale of the Phantom. The target becomes invisible until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If it hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, the creature it hits takes necrotic damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and is frightened of the target until the end of the frightened creature's next turn. \n  -- 9:  Tale of the Brute. Each creature of the target\u2019s choice it can see within 30 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes thunder damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and is knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t knocked prone. \n  -- 10:  Tale of the Dragon. The target spews fire from the mouth in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to four rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \n  -- 11:  Tale of the Angel. The target regains hit points equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier, and you end one condition from the following list affecting the target: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. \n  -- 12:  Tale of the Mind-Bender You envoke an incomprehensible fable from an otherworldly being. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take psychic damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and be stunned until the end of its next turn. \n\nSpirit Session\n\nAt 6th level, spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.\n\nThe spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of Divination or Necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn\u2019t count against the number of bard spells you know.\n\nOnce you perform the ritual, you can\u2019t do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.\n\nMystical Connection\n\nAt 14th level, you now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.\n\n"

      "description": "Star Map\n\nAt 2nd level, you've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.\n\nWhile holding this map, you have these benefits:\n\n  -- You know the Guidance cantrip.\n\n  -- You have the Guiding Bolt spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.\n\n  -- You can cast Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nIf you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement.

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.\n\nWhile in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.\n\nWhenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:\n\nArcher. A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.\n\nChalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.\n\nDragon. A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.\n\nCosmic Omen\n\nWhen you reach 6th level, you learn to use your star map to divine the will of the cosmos. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:\n\nWeal (even). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.\n\nWoe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.\n\nYou can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nTwinkling Constellations\n\nAt 10th level, the constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.\n\nMoreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.\n\nFull of Stars\n\nAt 14th level, while in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n"

Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.\n\nIn combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.

When a Small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal the creature or deal fire damage to it.

Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.\n\n",

You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip.\n\nArcane Shot\n\nAt 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see \"Arcane Shot Options\" below).\n\nOnce per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn\u2019t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.\n\nMagic Arrow\n\nAt 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.\n\nCurving Shot\n\nAt 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.\n\nEver-Ready Shot\n\nStarting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.\n\nArcane Shot Options\n\nThe Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.\n\nIf an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\n\nBanishing Arrow. You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\n\nAfter you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.\n\nBeguiling Arrow. Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.\n\nThe psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\nBursting Arrow. You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The arrow detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.\n\nThe force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\nEnfeebling Arrow. You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.\n\nThe necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\nGrasping Arrow. When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.\n\nThe poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\nPiercing Arrow. You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don\u2019t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.\n\nThe piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\nSeeking Arrow. Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don\u2019t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon\u2019s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target\u2019s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don\u2019t learn its location.\n\nThe force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\nShadow Arrow. You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe\u2019s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.\n\nThe psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\n"

When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don't already have temporary hit points.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nLegion of One\n\nAt 18th level, you can use a bonus action to create two echos with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can co-exist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo's position can be done from the other's instead.\n\nIn addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.\n\n"

      "name": "Fighter: Eldritch Knight",
      "description_short": "Source: Player's Handbook\n\nThe archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.\n\n",

You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.\n\nThe Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot.\n\nYou know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nThe spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.\n\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nWeapon Bond\n\nAt 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.\n\nOnce you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.\n\nYou can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.\n\nWar Magic\n\nBeginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.\n\nEldritch Strike\n\nAt 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.\n\nArcane Charge\n\nAt 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.\n\nImproved War Magic\n\nStarting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.\n\n"

You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.\n\nRunes Known\n  -- 3rd:  2 \n  -- 7th:  3 \n  -- 10th:  4 \n  -- 15th:  5 \n\nWhenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.\n\nThe following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.\n\n  -- Cloud Rune. This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.\n\nIn addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n\n  -- Fire Rune. This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.\n\nIn addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n\n  -- Frost Rune. This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.\n\nIn addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n\n  -- Stone Rune. This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nIn addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n\n  -- Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher). This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.\n\nIn addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n\n  -- Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher). Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.\n\nIn addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n\nGiant Might\n\nAt 3rd level, you have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:\n\n  -- If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.\n\n  -- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n\n  -- Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\n\nRunic Shield\n\nAt 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nGreat Stature\n\nBy 10th level, the magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll.\n\nMoreover, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.\n\nMaster of Runes\n\nAt 15th level, you can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nRunic Juggernaut\n\nAt 18th level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.\n\n"

      "name": "Way of the Ascendant Dragon",
      "description_short": "Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons\n\nThe fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic might, monks who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster their allies, and can even soar through the air on draconic wings. But all this power is in service of a greater goal: achieving a spiritual unity with the essence of the Material Plane.\n\n",
      "description": "As a follower of this Monastic Tradition, you decide how you unlocked the power of dragons through your ki. The Ascendant Dragon Origin table offers some possibilities.\n\nAscendant Dragon Origin\n  -- 1:  You honed your abilities by observing a dragon and aligning your ki with their world altering power. \n  -- 2:  A dragon personally took an active role in shaping your inner energy. \n  -- 3:  You studied at a monastery that traces its teachings back centuries or more to a single dragon\u2019s instruction. \n  -- 4:  You spent long stretches meditating in the region of influence of an ancient dragon\u2019s lair, absorbing its ambient magic. \n  -- 5:  You found a scroll written in Draconic that contained inspiring new techniques. \n  -- 6:  After a dream that featured a five-handed dragonborn you awoke with altered ki, reflecting the breaths of dragons. \n\nDraconic Disciple\n\nAt 3rd level, you can channel draconic power to magnify your presence and imbue your unarmed strikes with the essence of a dragon\u2019s breath. You gain the following benefits:\n\n  -- Draconic Presence. If you fail a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can use your reaction to reroll the check, as you tap into the mighty presence of dragons. Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n  -- Draconic Strike. When you damage a target with an unarmed strike, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.\n\n  -- Tongue of Dragons. You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.\n\nBreath of the Dragon\n\nAt 3rd level you can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt 11th level, the damage of this feature increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 ki points to use this feature again.\n\nWings Unfurled\n\nAt 6th level when you use your Step of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nAspect of the Wyrm\n\nAt 11th level the power of your draconic spirit now radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:\n\n  -- Frightful Presence. When you create this aura, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.\n\n  -- Resistance. Choose a damage type when you activate this aura: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You and your allies within the aura have resistance to that damage.\n\nOnce you create this aura, you can\u2019t create it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 ki points to create it again.\n\nAscendant Aspect\n\nAt 17th level, your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:\n\n  -- Augment Breath. When you use your Breath of the Dragon, you can spend 1 ki point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n  -- Blindsight. You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn\u2019t behind total cover, even if you\u2019re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.\n\n  -- Explosive Fury. When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).\n\n"

      "description": "Wild Magic Surge\n\nStarting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.\n\nTides of Chaos\n\nStarting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\n\nAny time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.\n\nBend Luck\n\nStarting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.\n\nControlled Chaos\n\nAt 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.\n\nSpell Bombardment\n\nBeginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.\n\nWild Magic Surge\n  -- 01-02:  Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.  51-52  A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to Magic Missile. \n  -- 03-04:  For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.  53-54  You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days. \n  -- 05-06:  A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears I minute later.  55-56  Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours. \n  -- 07-08:  You cast Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.  57-58  For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame. \n  -- 09-10:  You cast Magic Missile as a 5th-level spell.  59-60  You regain your lowest-level expended spell slot. \n  -- 11-12:  Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow.  61-62  For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. \n  -- 13-14:  You cast Confusion centered on yourself.  63-64  You cast Fog Cloud centered on yourself. \n  -- 15-16:  For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns.  65-66  Up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you take 4d10 lightning damage. \n  -- 17-18:  You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face.  67-68  You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. \n  -- 19-20:  You cast Grease centered on yourself.  69-70  Each creature within 30 feet of you becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a spell. \n  -- 21-22:  Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.  71-72  You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute. \n  -- 23-24:  Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A Remove Curse spell can end this effect.  73-74  A random creature within 60 feet of you becomes poisoned for 1d4 hours. \n  -- 25-26:  An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  75-76  You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. \n  -- 27-28:  For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action.  77-78  You cast Polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration. \n  -- 29-30:  You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see.  79-80  Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air within 10 feet of you for the next minute. \n  -- 31-32:  You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.  81-82  You can take one additional action immediately. \n  -- 33-34:  Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute.  83-84  Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to the sum of the necrotic damage dealt. \n  -- 35-36:  Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll.

If the roll is even, you get older.  85-86  You cast Mirror Image. \n  -- 37-38:  1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute.  87-88  You cast Fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. \n  -- 39-40:  You regain 2d10 hit points.  89-90  You become invisible for the next minute. During that time, other creatures can't hear you. The invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell. \n  -- 41-42:  You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.  91-92  If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the Reincarnate spell. \n  -- 43-44:  For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns.  93-94  Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. \n  -- 45-46:  You cast Levitate on yourself.  95-96  You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute. \n  -- 47-48:  A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.  97-98  You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute. \n  -- 49-50:  You can't speak for the next minute.

Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.\n\nIf the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.

As an action, you can speak your desire to your Genie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action.

The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\nHexblade Expanded Spells\n  -- 1st:  Shield, Wrathful Smite \n  -- 2nd:  Blur, Branding Smite \n  -- 3rd:  Blink, Elemental Weapon \n  -- 4th:  Phantasmal Killer, Staggering Smite \n  -- 5th:  Banishing Smite, Cone of Cold \n\nHexblade's Curse\n\nStarting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:\n\n  -- You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.\n\n  -- Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.\n\n  -- If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).\n\nYou can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nHex Warrior\n\nAt 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.\n\nThe influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.\n\nAccursed Specter\n\nStarting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).\n\nThe specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.\n\nOnce you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.\n\nArmor of Hexes\n\nAt 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade\u2019s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.\n\nMaster of Hexes\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.\n\n"

      "name": "Warlock: The Undead",
      "description_short": "Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft\n\nYou've made a pact with a deathless being, a creature that defies the cycle and life and death, forsaking its mortal shell so it might eternally pursue its unfathomable ambitions. For such beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains of sand still rush through life's hourglass. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.\n\n",
      "description": "Expanded Spell List\n\nAt 1st level, the Undead lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\nUndead Expanded Spells\n  -- 1st:  Bane, False Life \n  -- 2nd:  Blindness/Deafness, Phantasmal Force \n  -- 3rd:  Phantom Steed, Speak with Dead \n  -- 4th:  Death Ward, Greater Invisibility \n  -- 5th:  Antilife Shell, Cloudkill \n\nForm of Dread\n\nAt 1st level, you manifest an aspect of your patron\u2019s dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed:\n\n  -- You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.\n\n  -- Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\n\n  -- You are immune to the frightened condition.\n\nYou can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nThe appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your body might glow with glyphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds, suggesting your mummy patron.\n\nGrave Touched\n\nAt 6th level, your patron\u2019s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don\u2019t need to eat, drink, or breathe.\n\nIn addition, once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.\n\nNecrotic Husk\n\nAt 10th level, Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic damage.\n\nIn addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and cause your body to erupt with deathly energy. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level. You then gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you use this reaction, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.\n\nSpirit Projection\n\nAt 14th level, your spirit can become untethered from your physical form. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation.\n\nYour spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit\u2019s space (your choice).\n\nWhile projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:\n\n  -- Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n  -- When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn\u2019t require verbal or somatic components or material components that lack a gold cost.\n\n  -- You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.\n\n  -- While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\n"

      "name": "Warlock: The Undying",
      "description_short": "Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide\n\nDeath holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize \u2013 like all power \u2013 comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus.\n\n",
      "description": "Expanded Spell List\n\nThe Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\nUndying Expanded Spells\n  -- 1st:  False Life, Ray of Sickness \n  -- 2nd:  Blindness/Deafness, Silence \n  -- 3rd:  Feign Death, Speak with Dead \n  -- 4th:  Aura of Life, Death Ward \n  -- 5th:  Contagion, Legend Lore \n\nAmong the Dead\n\nStarting at 1st level, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease.\n\nAdditionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of Fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.\n\nDefy Death\n\nStarting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\nUndying Nature\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.\n\nIn addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.\n\nIndestructible Life\n\nWhen you reach 14th level, you partake of some of the true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n"

The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you. The teleportation can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.\n\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\n\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\n\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell.

When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.\n\n  -- The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.\n\n  -- You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.\n\nThis quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.\n\nAwakened Spellbook\n\nUsing specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.\n\nAt 2nd level, while you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:\n\n  -- You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\n  -- When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.\n\n  -- When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nIf necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.\n\nManifest Mind\n\nAt 6th level, you can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).\n\nWhile manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).\n\nWhenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.\n\nThe spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts Dispel Magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.\n\nMaster Scriviner\n\nAt 10th level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.\n\nThe chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.\n\nYou are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.\n\nOne with the Word\n\nAt 14th level, your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.\n\nMoreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.\n\nUntil you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spell book.\n\nOnce you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\n"

      "name": "Wizard: School of Transmutation",
      "description_short": "Sources: Player's Handbook\n\nYou are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.\n\n",
      "description": "Transmutation Savant\n\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.\n\nMinor Alchemy\n\nStarting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.\n\nTransmuter's Stone\n\nStarting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:\n\n  -- Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet\n\n  -- An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered\n\n  -- Proficiency in Constitution saving throws\n\n  -- Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)\n\nEach time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.\n\nIf you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.\n\nShapechanger\n\nAt 10th level, you add the Polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.\n\nOnce you cast Polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.\n\nMaster Transmuter\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.\n\nMajor Transformation. You can transmute one nonmagical object \u2013\u00a0no larger than a 5-foot cube \u2013\u00a0into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.\n\nPanacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.\n\nRestore Life. You cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.\n\nRestore Youth. You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.\n\n"

      "description": "Arcane Deflection\n\nAt 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.\n\nWhen you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.\n\nTactical Wit\n\nStarting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.\n\nPower Surge\n\nStarting at 6th level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells.\n\nYou can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with Dispel Magic or Counterspell, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.\n\nOnce per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.\n\nDurable Magic\n\nBeginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.\n\nDeflecting Shroud\n\nAt 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your wizard level.\n\n"
